Participants will explore several practical applications of natural language processing to business and engineering. Participants downloading, formatting, and parsing open-source text corpora for use in the remainder of the tutorial. Word frequency analysis will be pushed to its limit on these documents and then dimension will be employed to eek out further gains. Semantic analysis will then be employed by traversing a Word Net graph to calculate the similarity of word meanings to augment the usage statistic data. Participants will compute "factors" describing the sentiment of the documents and other latent characteristics. Participants will target subjects within those documents that interest them and discuss their results. Finally, participants will configure a chat bot plugin to respond to natural language commands and queries to produce complex behaviors.
