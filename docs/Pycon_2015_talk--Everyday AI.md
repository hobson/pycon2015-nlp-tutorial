Pycon 2015 Tutorial: Teaching a bot to Program Itself with `pug`
--------------------------------

`pug` is the PDX-Python Utility Glob, an open source package of modules and Django apps for natural language processing and machine learning. This tutorial will teach attendees how to program bots to perform complex behavior based on a knowledge base formed from natural language (unstructured text) available on their laptops. We will work through an example by teaching the open source python chat bot called "Will". The tutorial will conclude with attendees "teaching" an instantiation of Will on their laptops to "know" things about the laptop's user (the attendee) and respond to questions about this knowledge intelligently, using natural language queries.
