Practical Natural Language Processing
=====================================

Natural Language Processing Tutorial for PyCon 2015 in Montreal

Installation
------------

If you're wise enough to have `pip`, `virtualenv`, and `virtualenvwrapper` installed, you should create and activate a new virtualenv and project directory:

    mkproject pycon-nlp

On a modern, recent OS with `pip` installed, you just need to...

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don't yet have these awesome tools, you really should get them.

On OSX:

On a Redhat-based Linux (Centos, Fedora, RHEL):

    sudo yum install pip
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install virtualenvwrapper

On a Debian-based Linux (Ubuntu, Mint):

    sudo apt-get install pip
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install virtualenvwrapper
