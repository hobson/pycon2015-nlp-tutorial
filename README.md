Natural Language Processing Tutorial for PyCon 2015 in Montreal

Installation
------------

If you are foresightful enough to have `virtualenvwrapper` installed, you should create and activate a new virtualenv and project directory:

    mkproject pycon-nlp

On a modern, recent OS with `pip` installed, you just need to...

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don't yet have `pip` and `virtualenvwrapper` you really should.

On OSX:

On a Redhat-based Linux (Centos, Fedora, RHEL):

    sudo yum install pip
    pip install --upgrade pip

On a Debian-based Linux (Ubuntu, Mint):

    sudo apt-get install pip
    pip install --upgrade pip
